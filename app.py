Copy and paste the fixed app.py code I gave you in the last message

[ bigger box below it (optional) ]


📌 This is the area where you write your commit message.

✅ Step 4 — In the first small box, type:
Fixed code spacing and errors


You don’t need to type anything in the big box below (it’s optional).

✅ Step 5 — Then click the green button
